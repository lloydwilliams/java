## Payroll

This is a Spring Boot application that can be instrumented with Datadog APM and the logs can be collected and matched with the APM traces. 



Within the payroll folder is a `docker-compose` folder which will illustrate how you can run the payroll application in a docker container and the Datadog agent together. 

The configuration to run them both at the same time is in [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/lloydwilliams/java/blob/main/payroll/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml)
